## About
In November 2020, a team from Google DeepMind released AlphaFold 2 (AF2), an artificial intelligence (AI) system to predict 3D protein structure from an amino acid sequence. This website records publications pertaining to AF2 and its applications. Further, the [Examples](https://www.ayushnoori.com/alphafold-tracker/examples) page offers several interactive comparisons between experimentally-determined structures and AF2 predictions.

This website is publicly available at [www.ayushnoori.com/alphafold-tracker](https://www.ayushnoori.com/alphafold-tracker).
